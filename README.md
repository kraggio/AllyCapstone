# How to run the application

1. Copy our repository link and open up a new terminal (ensure you are cd in your desktop)

2. git clone the repository link : git clone https://github.com/kraggio/AllyCapstone.git

3. You now have this code on your desktop as a folder. Open this up in your preffered code editor

4. Once this folder is open, you can open a terminal within your editor, or continue working on the previous you were on (if working on previous, make sure you run cd AllyCapstone within that terminal. This will now take you to the project where you can complete your next step)

5. Once in AllyCapstone, run this command : npm install (this command installs necessary modules and packages in order to run the application)

6. Once the system is done with installing, in the same terminal, run this command : npm start
